# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in with your account (`anothercodingguy`)
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository details:**
   - Repository name: `vidhived-ai`
   - Description: `AI-powered legal document analysis and co-pilot application`
   - Visibility: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Your local repository is already set up! Just run these commands:

```bash
# You're already in the correct directory: C:\Users\Himanshu\Downloads\vidhived
# The repository is already initialized and committed

# Add the remote (update if repository name is different)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/anothercodingguy/vidhived-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
